What is this?
This is simply a script for Davinci Resolve which opens up a window that contains a list of all my commercial and free plugins.
Features:

Directly open up the installed plugins
Search and filter the plugins
Get news and offer
Easy Interface
Get direct links of my products
More coming soon...
What it's not?
Currently this app doesn't download any of my fuse plugin files or macros. This is a showcase application which will help users to search my scripts which are already installed on their system. My Resolve plugins can be downloaded from my store: 

But userbase and update system implementation is on the roadmap!
